# bubble_sort
This simple algorithm is used to compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are wrong order. Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of O(n^{2}) This algorithm is considered to perform slower in the real world and quicksor and merge sort are more recommended in replace of this. This is just for education purpose with RustLang
